[b]Looking for a bit of more armor buffs? Armor Modifiers is a small mod that enables vanilla-based reforging for armor. The Goblin Tinkerer can now add modifiers for your armor, albeit a bit more pricey compared to accessory counterparts.[/b]

[h1]Usage[/h1]
Simply head on over to the Goblin Tinkerer when you unlock him and place your armor into the reforge slot! Supports vanity, modded and even stackable armor types! 

When crafting armor, the default chance of having armor assigned a prefix is currently 50% (weapons and accessories have by default 75% in vanilla). Stats are only applicable when worn in the normal armor slots. This mod does not enable stats on the vanity slots. If there are issues with certain types of modded armor, refer to the original mod creators.
